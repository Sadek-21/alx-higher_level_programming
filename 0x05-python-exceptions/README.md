# Python - Exceptions

This repository contains solutions to Python tasks related to handling errors and exceptions.

## General Information

Python programming language offers robust mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions, making it a powerful tool for developing reliable software. This project focuses on understanding and implementing error handling techniques in Python.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will gain a deep understanding of the following concepts:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- How to use exceptions effectively
- When and how to handle exceptions
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise built-in exceptions
- Implementing clean-up actions after exceptions

## Requirements

- All code is written and tested in Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Code should adhere to PEP8 style guidelines.
- All files should end with a newline.
- The first line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file at the root of each project folder is mandatory.

## Task Descriptions

### 0. Safe list printing

- Write a function `safe_print_list` that prints elements of a list safely.
- Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions.
- Do not use `import` statements or `len()` function.

...

### 10. CPython #2: PyFloatObject

- Implement C functions to print basic information about Python lists, bytes, and float objects.
- Handle errors and exceptions according to the specified requirements.
