2. Area and Perimeter
Enhance the Rectangle class by adding methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

Implement the __repr__() method in a way that allows recreating a new instance using the eval() function.

5. Detect instance deletion
Print a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.

6. How many instances
Add a class attribute number_of_instances to keep track of the number of Rectangle instances.

7. Change representation
Enhance the Rectangle class to allow changing the symbol used to print the rectangle.
